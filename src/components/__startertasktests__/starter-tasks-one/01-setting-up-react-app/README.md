# Tests for Setup Basic Routing folder

---

## Test `aTestingFiles.test.js`

The purpose of this test is to ensure that the React components are located in the expected directories. It verifies that the components are correctly organized within the project structure and their file paths align with the provided paths.

**Notes:**

- The test code uses Jest, along with the `@testing-library/jest-dom` and `sabioExpect` libraries.
- The `filesAr` array contains objects representing the components to be tested, including component name, expected path, and expected file path.
- For each component, the test verifies if it can be successfully imported using the provided path and if the imported component matches the expected name.
- If the import or component name verification fails, an error message is generated.
- The `expectedMsg` variable holds the expected error message for each component, indicating the component name and expected file path.
- The `hint` variable provides troubleshooting hints if the import or component name verification fails.

**Note:** Review the test code for syntax errors and inconsistencies in the paths before executing the tests.

## Test `setupBasicRouting.test.js`

This test suite ensures that the basic routing setup in the React application is correct. It verifies that components render without errors, contain expected elements, are imported and rendered properly, and that route paths are correctly set up for each component.

**Notes:**

- The test code uses Jest, along with `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `sabioExpect`, `react-test-renderer`, `react`, and `react-router-dom` libraries.
- The test code includes imports for various components from different files in the project directory structure.
- Each test within the suite focuses on a specific aspect of routing setup.
- The `afterEach` function cleans up after each test execution.
- The suite uses methods from `react-test-renderer` to create and interact with component instances.
- The `MemoryRouter` component simulates routing behavior.
- The `render` function renders components and obtains rendered elements for further assertions.
- The `screen` object accesses elements on the screen.
- `expect` statements use custom assertions from `sabioExpect`.
- Error messages, hints, and additional information are provided for troubleshooting.
- Review the test code for syntax errors, missing imports, or inconsistencies in the file paths before executing the tests.

## Test `setupSiteNavComponent.test.js`

This test suite ensures that the SiteNav component functions correctly regarding rendering, link presence, and link functionality. It verifies that the component renders without errors, contains expected links, and the links have the correct route paths.

**Notes:**

- The test code uses Jest, along with `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `renderer`, and `sabioExpect` libraries.
- The `MemoryRouter` component simulates routing behavior.
- The `Link` component from `react-router-dom` is imported and used for testing.
- The `renderer` object is used to create and interact with component instances.
- The `siteNavRenderer` variable stores the rendered SiteNav component instance.
- The `linkComponents` variable stores an array of all Link components within the SiteNav component.
- The `beforeAll` function creates the SiteNav component instance and finds all Link components before running the tests.
- The `afterAll` function unmounts the SiteNav component after all tests have finished.
- `expect` statements are used for assertions.
